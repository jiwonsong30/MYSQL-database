Creative Portion:
1. Created a MyAccount page for logged in users to see all their posts and comments. In this page, you can upload a new post and edit/delete your posts and comments.

2. Created a feedback form so that the viewers/users of this website can provide suggestions to the administrator. 
	Once the feedback is submitted, it emails the feedback message to the administrator.

4. The user gets an email notification if someone comments on the user's post.
	
3. We created the option for logged in users to follow other users. You can follow users by clicking a 'follow' button in each post. 
	When you 'follow' someone, you will get email notifications when that person uploads a new post. 
	Once you follow someone, you will no longer see the 'follow' button on their posts. (this makes sense)
	Also you cannot follow yourself.
	You will not get an email notification for that person making new comments (we thought that would bomb your email with junk).

Additional information for TAs:

To check to see if you get an email notification from a followed user when he/she uploads a new post, i made a gmail account for the user 'cse330'.

email: cse330module3@gmail.com
password: module3_amy_jiwon

the user 'cse330' is already following 'jiwon', so if 'jiwon' uploads a new story, cse330 would get an email.
